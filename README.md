# Address-Book
Last week in the Microsoft Software Systems Academy my class was working on collection types. 
I decided to try to make my own console application using list and arrays that allowed the user
to add, remove, search, and view the entire list of the address book they have created. 
I plan on adding a database to this project soon that way the user will not have to retype every
person in the address book everytime they run the application. The people in the address book will
be stored in the database instead.
